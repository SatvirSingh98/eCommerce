When to use QuerySet?
--> If you want to be able perform some operation on an existing queryset in a chain of queryset calls you can use a QuerySet.
--> In ProductQuerySet we overide the all() method to get filtered by active items.
--> ModelManager functions are used like this:
    eg: Product.objects.featured() similar to default manager
--> QuerySet in models are used for chaining functionality to default ones.
    eg: Product.objects.get_featured().active()
--> We can also alter the functionality of default ones using QuerySet functions in models.
    eg: Like we alter all() func using active() QuerySet func by overriding get_queryset() func in Product model manager.

Now for using unique slug names we have used utils.py along with django signals.
--> pre_save is used to do something before the model is saved in the database. So unique slugs
    are created aotomatically before instance is saved.
