When to use QuerySet?
--> If you want to be able perform some operation on an existing queryset in a chain of queryset calls you can use a QuerySet.
--> In ProductQuerySet we overide the all() method to get filtered by active items.
--> ModelManager functions are used like this:
    eg: Product.objects.featured() similar to default manager
--> QuerySet in models are used for chaining functionality to default ones.
    eg: Product.objects.get_featured().active()
--> We can also alter the functionality of default ones using QuerySet functions in models.
    eg: Like we alter all() func using active() QuerySet func by overriding get_queryset() func in Product model manager.

Now for using unique slug names we have used utils.py along with django signals.
--> pre_save is used to do something before the model is saved in the database. So unique slugs
    are created aotomatically before instance is saved.

For search functionality:
--> Either we can use {{ request.GET.q }} in the template or
--> We can set query parameter using get_context_method:
    --> context['query'] = self.request.GET.q
    --> and then in the template use {{ query }}
    --> better to use context method as we can add more logic to it through views.

Search bar on page will come from same snippet file for same functionality.
We will implement queries using Q from model managers.
